I am a PhD candidate affialiated with [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at [the University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). Before that, I got a Master of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in 2019.

I have broad research interest in Probabilistic Machine Learning and High Performance Computing(HPC). Currently, my research focus on Bayesian-based active learning, Streaming Tensor Decomposition and Gaussian Kernel Method. Previously, I did research on CUDA Kernel speedup and control flow issue in HPC lab for nearly 2 years.

I am fortunate to work under supervision of [Dr. Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).

Feel free to connect me for collaboration in relative area.
