I am a PhD candidate affialiated with [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) at [the University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). Before that, I got master of science degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in 2019.

I have broad research interest in High Performance Computing and Probabilistic Machine Learning. Currently, my research focus on Bayesian-based active learning, tensor decomposition and kernel method. I am fortunate to work under supervision of [Dr. Shandian Zhe](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhe/).
